/**
 * Provides all classes to implement a Microsoft .msg single message container
 * through POI HSMF library.
 * <p>
 * The POI Apache is a pure java library for the reading Microsoft documents.
 * It's used to access the formatted msg file.
 * <p>
 * The Apache POI Project's mission is to create and maintain Java APIs for
 * manipulating various file formats based upon the Office Open XML standards
 * (OOXML) and Microsoft's OLE 2 Compound Document format (OLE2). In short, you
 * can read and write MS Excel files using Java. In addition, you can read and
 * write MS Word and MS PowerPoint files using Java. Apache POI is your Java
 * Excel solution (for Excel 97-2008). We have a complete API for porting other
 * OOXML and OLE2 formats and welcome others to participate.
